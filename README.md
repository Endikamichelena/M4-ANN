# M4-ANN
Group assignment 1.

You can find here an example of a well performing Artificial Neural Network (using PyTorch), with a simple architecture used for a classification problem.
You can also find some playing around with layers, hyperparameters and so on. We didn't validated the data, that would be a plus.

Steps:

# Preparing the data
## Penguins dataset
## Processing the data

# ANN with PyTorch
## 1st variation
## 2nd variation
## 3rd variation
## 4th variation
## 5th variation
